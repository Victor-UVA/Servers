# Destop Computers

Computers available in Victor Lab for use by anyone in the lab.

## Operating Systems

Most machines in the lab, both stationary and mobile, run Ubuntu Linux. This is pretty much the OS to run ROS and has a decent user 
interface for linux distros. If there is a solution possible on linux, you should aim for that ecosystem as its the most compatible and
extensible for development. Ubuntu 18 has been the most common OS running ROS Melodic, however Ubuntu 20 / ROS2 will soon become the new standard.
ROS2 is only partially compatible with ROS1, which has examples online. ROS2 offers superior functionality among many robotic systems, including
communication between bot and server or other bots, making cooperation much simpler.

Windows is also common to install on machines. It's useful for running applications that need Windows. 

If part of your work requires a different operating system, you might be able to find another computer that runs what you need or you could install 
or dual boot onto a desktop you're already working with. Most modern HDD or SDD storages attached are large enough for 2+ partitions, however consider
the requirements of the existing OS, new OS, and hardware you are installing on. ROS (with real robots) works best on installed OS, not VMs. Docker
could be a good work around, as long as its able to access machine peripherals and given enough resources. 

## Acquisition and Reclamation

If there is a desktop computer plugged into a monitor, is a good assumption that someone wants it to stay there. We have machines and parts usually
stacked up somewhere, although you'll need to figure out if it is functional and can run. Mini computers such as NUKs can be used as desktops or as mobile
computers. 

Consider the timeframe of the project you are working on. If the computer is only needed temporarily, then it is ususally ok to use or move it during 
the work, although always replace equipment once the work is complete. If you need dedicated hardware, consider ordering new components or clearly 
designating the equipment for single use. 

Stacked machines are probably fair game for scavaging. It's better to combine components we already have to accomplish the goal, rather than continuously
purchasing new stuff. 

## Users and Passwords

Most lab computers have one user and password: `password`. 

If installing a new OS, the default user is `victor` and password `password`. However if you are making a "thing" that has a name, then that could
be the username. For example Sisyphus is `sisyphus` and the Hal 9000 server is `hal9000`.

The 3D printer desktop is special because it's from the other school we don't talk about. Password is writen on the side.
